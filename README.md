# SS2 Deterioration Mod
A common oversight in a lot of immersive sims is resource overabundance as the player progresses through the game. Part of the cause of this issue is item hoarding.

In System Shock 2 it's very frequent for players to create "item piles" in various safe areas, such as inside the elevator shaft or the safe area inside Cryo on the Med/Sci deck.
These item piles generally allow players to hoard resources and keep items for later, which undermines the value of the inventory system and leads to an overabundance of items.

This mini-mod makes any items which are discarded from the players inventory deteriorate after 10 minutes without being picked up, losing stacks until they eventually disappear altogether.

For more information, please see the System Shock Modifications Archive thread [here](https://www.systemshock.org/index.php?topic=12198.0)

Packaged releases are usually posted on the forum thread. This repo exists as a backup, and as somewhere for anyone interested to grab my source files.

## Info for Modders

This mod was made using [makedml](https://github.com/tunbridgep/ss2-makedml). This means the DML files are split into multiple different files.

You can also manually create a build by moving the contents of the src/$core directory to your System Shock 2/DMM/Deterioration folder.
